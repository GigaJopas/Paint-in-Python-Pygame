# Paint-in-Python-Pygame
Remake of paint using Pygame.

Includes: square/circle brush, RGB color and brush/eraser size pickers using textboxes.

You need to hover over textboxes to write in them, clicking does nothing.

The brush creates a lot of circles/squares instead of a solid line because I don't know how to make it otherwise.

No saving to file for a similar reason.
